title: Orpheus has more fun, and extras
---

Well, smokes. That was fun. It's almost Monday again. Ugh. Orpheus hates Mondays. Mondays are always so boring and dull. And she has to do the dishes. Yes, she's unfortunately collected an untolerable pile of dishes from the past few days. A few too many pancakes have been consumed, and too many cups of tea have been drunk.

*Hm*, Orpheus says out loud. *You know what we would be fun?* A competition! I'm a little bit interested now. **To see who can write the best, silliest language while still managing to be Turing-complete!!!**

Just between the two of us? I point at the two of us. Orpheus shakes her head. No. We should have more people!

I like the idea of this.

Interested? If you're a teenager, Hack Club is running a programming language jam from now (May 01) until July 01. Write a programming language, get a terminal-in-a-box that can run your programming language!

Here's the criteria:

* Minimally, should have the following features: variables, looping (think: for/while loops), conditional branching (think: if/else statements) and some form of recursion (think: functions). *Why? These are what make a programming language [Turing-complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete)*.

That's it! The [community](https://hackclub.com/slack) will vote on what language does the following the best:

* Creativity and silliness! 
* Bonus points if you explain your implementation (especially if you did something that Orpheus hasn't learned while writing Easel).

And the top five will get a hard copy of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)!

The gist: write a programming language &rarr; record a demo video with [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) and write a quick guide on how to get up and running with your programming language (including build instructions, if any!) &rarr; open a PR with these three things and your name on [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack).

**Check out what other teenagers have made on the front page!** [TODO - this information will be moved to the front page]

Orpheus is personally going to get the easel working now. [TODO: Actually get it working?! We have the board in real life, after all. Will update you.]

## Resources

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is a great, accessible next step.

Check out [#programming-lang-jam](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C06T22ZFQGP) on the Hack Club Slack if you're a teenager to hang out with other teenagers working on building programming languages!

## Acknowledgements

Acknowledgements: Hack Club. Friends. Some of Orpheus' silly habits or choices like dinner for breakfast, running a marathon (on an impulse) are things I do with friends or friends have convinced me to do. One such decision was to drive to Boston one weekend to stay up extra late and hack on projects.

All code, including this website, is fully open source on [GitHub]().

If you're a teenager and find this cool, join [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)! We work on extra cool projects we call _You Ship, We Ship_, where you build something cool with friends and we do too, like [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com) and [OnBoard](https://onboard.hackclub.com)!
