title: Orpheus decodes the program, and extras

And now it's time for the grand finale: getting the easel to work.

Orpheus picks up the easel again and flips it over. Oops. We forgot one question. How do we turn this thing on? No, I don't think smacking the easel is the correct move to make here, Orpheus.

You know what?

### In which we find out our mysterious sender

Let's run the program now.

[sputters] What???

Just then there's another knock on the door. Orpheus, I think that'

He left us another letter, though.

Congratulations on figuring out the easel.

I know you're a tad bit disappointed that you haven't figured out who I am, but it's about the journey along the way. You're probably doing something funky with your face right now.

But I digress! You just made magic happen! Isn't that amazing? You got the easel working. You're a artist and a magician and a hacker, Orpheus.

Signed, 
your mysterious sender

I guess we'll never figure out who our mysterious sender is.

Well, smokes. That was fun. It's almost Monday again. Ugh. Orpheus hates Mondays. Mondays are always so boring and dull. And she has to do the dishes. Yes, she's unfortunately collected an untolerable pile of dishes from the past few days. A few too many pancakes have been consumed, and too many cups of tea have been drunk.

_Hm_, Orpheus says out loud. _You know what we would be fun?_ A competition! I'm a little bit interested now. **To see who can write the best, silliest language while still managing to be Turing-complete!!!**

Just between the two of us? I point at the two of us. Orpheus shakes her head. No. We should have more people!

I like the idea of this.

Interested? If you're a teenager, Hack Club is running a programming language jam from now (May 01) until July 01. Write a programming language, get a terminal-in-a-box that can run your programming language!

Here's the criteria:

- Minimally, should have the following features: variables, looping (think: for/while loops), conditional branching (think: if/else statements) and some form of recursion (think: functions). _Why? These are what make a programming language [Turing-complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete)_.

That's it! The [community](https://hackclub.com/slack) will vote on what language does the following the best:

- Creativity and silliness!
- Bonus points if you explain your implementation (especially if you did something that Orpheus hasn't learned while writing Easel).

And the top five will get a hard copy of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)!

The gist: write a programming language &rarr; record a demo video with [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) and write a quick guide on how to get up and running with your programming language (including build instructions, if any!) &rarr; open a PR with these three things and your name on [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack).

Interested! Get more info [here](https://github.com/hackclub/easel).

Hi! I'm [@jc](https://github.com/jianmin-chen). I wrote this with Orpheus, but this wouldn't have been possible without: Hack Club. Friends. Some of Orpheus' silly habits or choices like dinner for breakfast, running a marathon (on an impulse) are things I do with friends or friends have convinced me to do. One such decision was to drive to Boston on weekends to stay up extra late and hack on projects like this.

All code, including this website, is fully open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackclub/easel).

If you're a teenager and find this cool, join [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)! We work on extra cool projects we call _You Ship, We Ship_, where you build something cool with friends and we do too, like [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com) and [OnBoard](https://onboard.hackclub.com)!
