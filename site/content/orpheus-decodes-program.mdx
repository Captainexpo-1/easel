And now it's time for the grand finale: getting the easel to work.

Orpheus picks up the easel again and flips it over. Oops. We forgot one question. How do we turn this thing on? No, I don't think smacking the easel is the correct move to make here, Orpheus.

What if we took a look at the source code of the easel? It looks something like this:

      const height = 64

      let canvas, ctx, cellSize

      const clear = () => {
        ctx.fillStyle = 'white'
        ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)
        ctx.fillStyle = defaultColor
        for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
          for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
            ctx.fillRect(
              x * cellSize + gap * x,

        ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

Our first step should be to tweak that canvas class of ours to fit this. Remember how Orpheus mentioned while we were writing our interpreter that the idea was to take our digital canvas and map it onto a real canvas? We're going to do that by creating a `CustomCanvas` that extends from our OG canvas:

<Editor initialTab="index.html">
```js
import stdlib, { Canvas } from "./stdlib.js"

// ...
let canvas, ctx, cellSize

class CustomCanvas extends Canvas {
  fill([x, y, color]) {
    let cell = this.grid[y * this.cols + x]
    if (cell) {
      cell.r = color.r
      cell.g = color.g
      cell.b = color.b

      ctx.fillStyle = `rgb(${cell.r}, ${cell.g}, ${cell.b})`
      ctx.fillRect(
        x * cellSize + gap * x,
        y * cellSize + gap * y,
        cellSize,
        cellSize
      )
    }
  }

  erase([x, y]) {
    ctx.fillStyle = defaultColor
    ctx.fillRect(
      x * cellSize + gap * x,
      y * cellSize + gap * y,
      cellSize,
      cellSize
    )
  }
}
```

  If you've written an Arduino program before (it was the first example I could think of off the top of my head!), you'll notice this logic is pretty similar to the `setup()` and `loop()` functions that are the core of every Arduino program.
</aside>

Now that we have an extension (it's not that different, is it?), we can run `program.easel`! We're going to have the same pipeline of lexer &rarr; parser &rarr; interpreter, but this time around, we'll going to add one condition - we'll refresh our easel every so often if our Easel program has a `painting` function. How do we know if it does? Why, by searching our global scope, of course!

<Editor initialTab="index.html">
```js
import stdlib, { Canvas } from "./stdlib.js"
import { Lexer } from "./lexer.js"
import { Parser } from "./parser.js"
import { Interpreter } from "./interpreter.js"

window.onload = () => {
  // ...
  clear()

  fetch("/program.easel").then(res => res.text()).then(code => {
    // Run program
    const lexer = new Lexer(code)
    lexer.scanTokens()
    const parser = new Parser(lexer.tokens)
    parser.parse()
    const interpreter = new Interpreter()
    let scope = interpreter.run(parser.ast, {
      ...stdlib,
      Canvas: new CustomCanvas()
    })

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      if (!interpreter.inScope(scope, "painting")) return clearInterval(interval)

      ctx.fillStyle = "white"
      ctx.fillRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height)

      try {
        const lexer = new Lexer("painting()")
        lexer.scanTokens()
        const parser = new Parser(lexer.tokens)
        parser.parse()
        scope = interpreter.run(parser.ast, scope)
      } catch {
        clearInterval(interval)
      }
    }, 100)
  }).catch(err => console.log(err))

  window.addEventListener("resize", resize)
}
```

  Also pat yourself on the back.

If you head over to the Easel tab and click Run, it works now! You know what that means?

### In which we find out our mysterious sender

Heck yeah! We can finally use the little program our sender has given to us. It's our only clue. Let's run the program now.

<Editor initialTab="whoami.easel">

What???

Just then there's another knock on the door. Orpheus, I think that's our man. Now's our chance to find out who he is, exactly!

Orpheus <strike>runs</strike> stomps over to the door, but there's no one there, again. The only difference is that it's sunny outside now. Oh well. 

He left us another letter, though.

Congratulations on figuring out the easel.

I know you're a tad bit disappointed that you haven't figured out who I am, but it's about the journey along the way. You're probably doing something funky with your face right now.

But I digress! You just made magic happen! Isn't that amazing? You got the easel working. You're an artist a magician and a hacker, Orpheus.

Signed, 
your mysterious sender

I guess we'll never figure out who our mysterious sender is. But he's right, I guess? 

Ooh, Orpheus. You know what we should do? We should celebrate with a picnic.

... 

I can't tell if I'm always hungry or if Orpheus is. Maybe the both of us.

Well, smokes. That was fun. It's almost Monday again. Ugh. Orpheus hates Mondays. Mondays are always so boring and dull. And she has to do the dishes. Yes, she's unfortunately collected an intolerable pile of dishes from the past few days. A few too many pancakes have been consumed, and too many cups of tea have been drunk.

_Hm_, Orpheus says out loud. _You know what we would be fun?_ A competition! I'm a little bit interested now. **To see who can write the best, silliest language while still managing to be Turing-complete!!!**

Just between the two of us? I point at the two of us. Orpheus shakes her head. No. We should have more people!

I like the idea of this.

Hi! I'm [@jc](https://github.com/jianmin-chen). I wrote this with Orpheus, but this wouldn't have been possible without: Hack Club. Friends. Some of Orpheus' silly habits or choices like dinner for breakfast, and running a marathon (on an impulse) are things I do with friends, or friends have convinced me to do. One such decision was to drive to Boston on weekends to stay up extra late and hack on projects like this.

All code, including this website, is fully open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackclub/easel).
