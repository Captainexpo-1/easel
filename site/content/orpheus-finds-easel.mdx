title: Orpheus finds an easel in the mail
order: 1
---

It's a normal Saturday for Orpheus the dino. She wakes up, lies in bed for a while, and looks out the window.

It's raining outside! She likes rainy days. You can hear the rain splattering every time a car comes by, and the soft pitter patter on the windows. It's the best sound. Add pancakes for breakfast and lunch but especially dinner and it's got to be the best day ever.

<aside>
  Yes, Orpheus gets fan mail. If you want to send her some after reading this you can send them to 15 Falls Road, Shelburne VT 05482.
</aside>

Just then, the post office truck passes by and stops. Normally the mailman just stops by to drop off fan mail in the mailbox, but today he has a bigger, bulkier package. Orpheus hops up and walks to the 

## Easel, the programming language

Orpheus gingerly opens the package and pulls out the contents one by one. She recognizes the first item instantly. It's an easel!

*Here's the [easel in question](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5362?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiYOxBhC5ARIsAIvdH526LPYOruOasZj9FkW5TYN6OlXZMV3q0ER-CwS5_S9a3JUZIJ-4d2UaAkGhEALw_wcB).*

I hope this letter finds you well.

Signed,

Ooh.

  Go ahead. Type it out! It's good for your health. Well, to be specific, it's
  good for Orpheus' health. She only has three claws (fingers?) on either hand.
  Her hand-o-pedon (yes, I learned today that it's a thing) says it's good for
  her health. I trust docotors. [shrugs]

```easel
prepare rows as 50
prepare cols as 20

brush Cell has { x, y, live }

~ Exercise: try setting a custom pattern instead of randomness! 
sketch seed {
  prepare cells as []
  loop x through (0, rows) {
    loop y through (0, cols) {
      prepare live as false
      prepare chance as random(0, 100)
      if (chance < 20) {
        prepare live as true
      }
      cells.add(prep Cell(x: x, y: y, live: live))
    }
  }
  finished cells
}

prepare cells as seed()

sketch getNeighbors needs (cells, index) {
  ~ Get neighbors around seed
}
```

I bet you can already start to see the different features Easel has.

### Variables

Variables are created with the `prepare` keyword and `as` keywords, like `prepare [name] as [value]`. We can have strings, numbers, or booleans.

### Comments

<aside>
  Grammar mistake! It's not "Me and Orpheus", it's "Orpheus and I"! Call the grammar police!
</aside>

Comments are dictated by the tilde symbol. Me and Orpheus have decided that it looks pretty similar to her eyebrows when she's surprised by something.

## Functions

We call functions sketches, so 

## Setup

Let's start doing this! Orpheus wants to make sure we've got the basics now. It's like building Lego, really. The first step is to open dat terminal and start a new project:

```
mkdir easel
cd easel
npm init -y
```

<aside>
  Orpheus wants this to be useful for anyone who knows a bit of JavaScript. Here, all we're doing is creating a imprt
</aside>

Open up the `package.json` that's been created, and add this extra line:

```json
{
  // ...
  "type": "module"
}
```

This will let us use the modern `import` syntax. Next, let's start writing some code! Here's some boilerplate code to go inside `easel.js`:

```js
import fs from 'fs'

const readFile = location =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    fs.readFile(location, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) return reject(err)
      resolve(data.toString())
    })
  )

const writeFile = (location, data) =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    fs.writeFile(location, data, err => {
      if (err) return reject(err)
      resolve()
    })
  )

;(async () => {
  let argv = process.argv.slice(2)
  const debug = argv.find(cmd => cmd === '--dbg') ? true : false
  argv = argv.filter(arg => arg !== '--dbg')

  const location = argv[0]
  if (location) {
    const program = await readFile(location)
    console.log(program)
  }
})
```

You can run `node easel.js test.easel` now and it's rather boring. We could probably spruce it up a bit by writing that programming language. Let's get a-moving!
