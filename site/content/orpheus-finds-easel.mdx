title: Orpheus finds an easel in the mail
order: 1
---

It's a normal Saturday for Orpheus the dino. She wakes up, lies in bed for a while.

It's raining outside! She likes rainy days.

First up, some setup. We're going to store our program.

<aside>
  Go ahead. Type it out! It's good for your health. Well, to be specific, it's
  good for Orpheus' health. She only has three claws (fingers?) on either hand.
  Her hand-o-pedon (yes, I learned today that it's a thing) says it's good for
  her health. I trust docotors. [shrugs]

```easel
prepare rows as 50
prepare cols as 20

brush Cell has { x, y, live }

~ Exercise: try setting a custom pattern instead of randomness!
sketch seed {
  prepare cells []
  loop x through (0, rows) {
    loop y through (0, cols) {

    }
  }
}
```

The setup here might be a little confushing
