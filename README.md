Write a programming language, get a terminal-in-a-box to run your programming language on! From now until July 01, we're also running a programming language jam, where you'll also have the chance to win a copy of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The gist: write a programming language &rarr; record a demo video with [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) and write a quick guide on how to get up and running with your programming language (including build instructions, if any!) &rarr; open a PR with these three things and your name on [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack), and then submit the form [here](https://easel.hackclub.com/submit).

Check out [#langjam](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C06T22ZFQGP) on the Slack to hang out with fellow teenagers hacking on programming languages.

## Step one: write your programming language!

Here's the criteria:

- Minimally, should have the following features: variables, looping (think: for/while loops), conditional branching (think: if/else statements) and some form of recursion (think: functions). _Why? These are what make a programming language [Turing-complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete)_.

That's it! The [community](https://hackclub.com/slack) will vote on what language does the following the best:

- Creativity and silliness! 
- Bonus points if you explain your implementation.

And the top five will get a hard copy of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) while we're running our programming jam!

**But what if you don't know how to write a programming language?** Never fear, Orpheus the dinosaur to the rescue! We've written a guide on writing a programming language from scratch that'll teach you how to write a programming language called [Easel](https://easel.hackclub.com):

## Step two: record a demo!

Record a demo of your programming language in action. Preferably, [Asciinema]()

## Step three: open a PR!

## Step four: get your terminal-in-a-box in the mail!
